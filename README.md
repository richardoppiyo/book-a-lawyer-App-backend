# Book a lawyer App

> This repository is a Ruby on Rails developed banckend API only application  named "Book a lawyer App". The purpose of the project is to automate the law services. The Application allows an authenticated user to log in to the system, get a list of all available lawyers whose can be bookeed for a specified amount. The lawyers' bio has the contact details, location, pricing per hour of the lawyer from which a user gets more insights. It also has dedicated pages to see a user's reservations and a reserve form. An admin user has the right to add/remove a lawyer from the database and hence can see the Manage tab.
